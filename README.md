# user-system
It’s a basic project, but it will help you to practice very useful skills because the user is a part of almost every application. 

In this project, you will learn:  - how to set up the database and do migrations,  - how to create a new user by the registration,  - how to build login endpoint,  - how to authenticate user,  - how to get the user’s data.

In the case of registration and login, you should generate a JWT token for the user that will be returned from the API.

Besides that, remember to hash the password before you save it in the database.
